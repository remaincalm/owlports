# owlports
OWL-compatible ports of remaincalm plugins.

Contents:
* Floaty: modulated delay
* Mud: modulated filter
* Paranoia: complex lo-fi digital distortion

Major changes:
* Oriented effects for 4 params each

Note: due to OWL requirements for "everything in a single .hpp", these all might be a bit rough.
